# Governance Contract Deployment Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem (SOLVED)
The deployment was failing with "insufficient energy" error - NOT a contract size issue!

## Root Cause
VeChain uses a dual-token system:
- **VET** - Main token (you have this)
- **VTHO** - Energy/gas token (you need this for transactions)

VTHO is generated automatically by holding VET, but the deployer account doesn't have enough VTHO yet.

## Solution
Get VTHO for your deployer account `0x034Fd1eBf7328C4511f5a1f80cD470546f2953dA`:

### Option 1: Wait for VTHO Generation (Recommended)
- VET automatically generates VTHO over time
- 1 VET generates ~0.000432 VTHO per day
- Wait a few hours/days for sufficient VTHO to accumulate

### Option 2: Get VTHO from Faucet
- Visit VeChain testnet VTHO faucet (if available)
- Or transfer some VTHO to the deployer address

### Option 3: Use VeChain Energy (Fee Delegation)
- Enable fee delegation in hardhat.config.js
- Use VeChain Energy service to sponsor gas

## Contract Status
✅ Governance contract is optimized and ready to deploy
✅ Contract size is fine (2.5KB - well under limits)
✅ All other contracts deployed successfully
❌ Only blocked by lack of VTHO for gas

## Next Steps
1. Get VTHO for deployer account
2. Run: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-governance-only.js --network vechainTestnet`
3. Governance will deploy successfully once VTHO is available

## Contracts Ready to Deploy
- Governance.sol - Minimal IPFS-based governance (100 B3TR to vote/propose, 3-day voting)
